## 🏆 **Project Goals**
To analyze and visualize global health metrics, focusing on:
- 🌱 **Life Expectancy**: Trends by gender and region.
- ⚖️ **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Comparisons across demographics.
- 🌏 **Population Growth**: Fastest-growing regions.
- 🧬 **Cancer Incidence**: Insights by type and country.
This project supports healthcare organizations in making informed decisions for targeted interventions and resource allocation.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards.
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **PowerPoint**: Presentation of findings.

## 📋 **Process**
### 1. Dataset Exploration 🔍
- Imported and explored the Gapminder health dataset in Tableau.
- Identified key variables like life expectancy, BMI, and population growth.
### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation 🧹
- Cleaned data in Excel (handled duplicates, missing values, and formatting).
- Created calculated fields in Tableau for metrics like BMI categories.
### 3. Dashboard Design 📊
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Region, gender, and time-period filters.
  - Line charts for population growth.
  - Bar charts for BMI and life expectancy.
  - Heatmaps for cancer incidence.
### 4. Insights and Recommendations 💡
- Highlighted patterns and proposed healthcare strategies for global health improvement.

## 🚀 **Key Insights**
1. 🌟 Men globally have a **higher life expectancy** (69 years) than women (64 years).
2. ⚖️ Women show slightly **higher BMI levels** (24.8) than men (24.1).
3. 📈 **Africa** leads in population growth, while **Europe** shows low or negative growth rates.
4. 🧬 **China** has the highest cancer incidence, dominated by liver cancer.

## 💡 **Recommendations**
- **🧬 High Cancer Regions**: Allocate resources to countries like China.
- **⚖️ Promote Healthy Lifestyles**: Encourage balanced diets in regions with high BMI.
- **🌍 Support Low-Life-Expectancy Regions**: Invest in healthcare infrastructure.
- **📈 Target Rapid Growth Areas**: Develop solutions for Africa and Asia.
